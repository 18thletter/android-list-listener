android-debugger
================

This is my portion of a project for a course at SFSU Internet Application Design and Development in Spring 2011. The full project is an educational Android game to teach programming techniques. The full project can be found at http://code.google.com/p/csc667-android-debugger/.

I implemented an interface within the game displays a log of questions the student has encountered. Clicking on the item would expand the list with its options and the player's choice. The log is also searchable, providing suggestions as letters are typed.

In addition to the question log, I implemented the ability for the user to skip a question by shaking the mobile device.
