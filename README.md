Educational Android Game
========================

This is my portion of a project for an SFSU course during Spring 2011 called Internet Application Design and Development. The full project is an educational Android game to teach programming techniques. The full project can be found at http://code.google.com/p/csc667-android-debugger/.

Expandable, Searchable List
---------------------------
I implemented an interface within the game which displays a log of questions the player has encountered. Clicking on the item expands the question with its options and the player's choice. The log is also searchable, providing suggestions as letters are typed.

Shake Motion Detector
---------------------
In addition to the question log, I implemented the ability for the player to skip a question by shaking the mobile device.
